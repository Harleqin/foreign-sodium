This is just plumbing to use libsodium from Common Lisp.

You need to install libsodium yourself, e. g. through your system's package
manager.

Current status: it works on my computer.  It should find libsodium.so if you
have a unix-like system and it is in /lib/, /usr/lib/, or /usr/local/lib/.  The
grovelling should also find sodium/crypto_*.h if those are installed where the C
compiler finds them (most likely /usr/include/).  You might have to install
another package (e. g. libsodium-dev on Debian derivatives like Ubuntu) to
actually get the header files.

I have so far covered only authenticated encryption ("crypto_box") including
tests, more is to come.  Note that the tests are only unit tests, thus test
functionality, not that there are no side channel attacks (in particular
timing).

History: I had translated TweetNaCl to Common Lisp at 30c3 (see
https://github.com/Harleqin/naclcl.git), but it was tedious trying to bring it
to work.  So, on 31c3, a new plan: first get it to work with CFFI, then I can
start to develop native (Lisp) drop-in replacements for parts of it.
